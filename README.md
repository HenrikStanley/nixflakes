# Desktop Nixdots

I use gnome-shell on my desktop NixOS machine. To read my Gnome specific configurations you can navigate to:


## Gnome
[Enable Gnome](https://github.com/erictossell/nixdots/blob/main/desktop/modules/gnome.nix)

[Customize Gnome with Home-Manager](https://github.com/erictossell/nixdots/blob/main/desktop/modules/gnome-home.nix)

#### Disabling Hyprland
Enabling Gnome does require disabling Hyprland.

Thanks to the nature of NixOS this is trivial and the two modes can be interchanged reliably. 

Doing this often will have an impact on your SSD lifetime.
